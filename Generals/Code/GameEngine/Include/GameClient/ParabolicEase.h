/**
 * This ends up being a function that is parabolic at both ends and a linear
 * middle section with respect to position.
 *
 * velocity(0.0) = 0.0
 * velocity(in) = v0
 * velocity(out) = v0
 * velocity(1.0) = 0.0
 *
 * From 0.0->in velocity is linearly increasing.
 * From out->1.0 velocity is linearly decreasing.
 *
 * velocity(t) = v0*t/in					t = [0, in]			Linear increasing segment
 *						 = v0								t = (in, out]		Constant segment
 *						 = (1-t)*v0/(1-out)	t = (out, 1.0]	Linear decreasing segment
 *
 * We need to calculate v0.  We want the total distance covered to be 1.0.
 *
 * 1 = integral(velocity(t), 0, 1)
 * 1 = integral(velocity(t), 0, in) +
 * 		 integral(velocity(t), in, out) +
 * 		 integral(velocity(t), out, 1.0)
 * 1 = v0*in/2 + v0*(out - in) + v0*(1 - out)/2
 * 	 = v0*(out-in+1)/2
 * v0 = 2/(out-in+1)
 *
 * Now we can calculate the distance function.
 *
 * d(0->in)		= integral(velocity(t), 0, s)
 *						= v0*s*s/(2*in)
 * d(in->out) = d(0->in) + integral(velocity(t), in, s)
 *						= (v0*in/2) + (v0*(s - in))
 * d(out->1)	= d(0->in) + d(in->out) + integral(velocity(t), out, s)
 * 						= (v0*in/2) + (v0*(out - in)) + (s-s*s/2-out+out*out/2)*v0/(1-out)
