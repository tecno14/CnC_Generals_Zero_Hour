// v1   - Normal vector - used for other fun stuff.
//      - v1.x = index for the motion wave data 
//      - v1.y = color scale factor for darkening.
//      - v1.z = z coordinate value of the base of the tree/grass/bush.
// v2   - Diffuse color
// v7   - Vertex Texture Data u,v 
// c4-7  - Composite World-View-Projection Matrix
// c8  - Tilt vector.
// c32  - offset for shroud texture mapping
// c33  - scale for shroud texture mapping
